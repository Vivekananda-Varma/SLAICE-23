Maitrayee - Embroidery
I was first introduced to embroidery in P2 or P3. At that point, it was just a way to pass time and I didn't enjoy embroidery either.
It was during the lockdown that my interest in embroidery got aroused. 
‘The Starry Night’ was something I'd always wanted to try out, as I wanted to create something striking and unusual.
I started embroidering ‘The Starry Night’ last year (E4) for the first project week and worked on it occasionally for over a year. 
Quite often, I would not like the way a colour would look, forcing me to undo all the stitches and work on it again, which was irritating. Another issue was bending the needle while stitching and eventually getting poked on my fingers. Other than that, I faced no other challenges and am extremely satisfied with the way my embroidery turned out!
