Aura- Painting 
Art
Why have I chosen this medium?
I never liked art. I didn't appreciate it much. During the lockdown I ran out of things to do so I tried to find something interesting from Social Media. I came across a lot of art and craft videos which I wanted to try out on my own. That’s when I started to work on Mandalas and slowly got into painting. Since then I’ve really been into fine arts.
Art helps me express myself. It’s a way to channel my energy and emotions. It helped me concentrate and focus longer, I also learned the fact that creating beautiful pieces takes time and that you should never hurry with anything.
How much time do I dedicate to my art?
During the lockdown, I used to spend a lot of time on my art. I often worked on my artwork overnight. As school resumed, I barely had time. Nowadays I draw once every three weeks or sometimes more.
Are there any challenges that arise in my process?
I come across a lot of problems, such as, sometimes while drawing the ink accidentally spills out or goes off line, and I have to do something to fix the mistake. I have had other problems such as once I had chosen a Mandala artwork online which I thought I would replicate, but when I started to draw, I realised that there was no room for the whole drawing to fit, the proportions were not right and I'd already started to ink it. It has also happened that my pen ran out of ink while I was running it over my Mandala. All these incidents required me to think of a solution fast. I’ve had problems while taking photos of my art because different projects required a background that matched them well, I also faced problems with the lights and the angles. My art has required me to make numerous adjustments. Every time I create a new piece of art, I face new challenges.
