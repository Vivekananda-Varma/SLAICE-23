Volker and Raphael are two close friends, one German and the other French under unfortunate circumstances. The stage is set during the early times of World War II, a friend against a friend, for life or for death. An action that could change his whole life.
Face-to-face, both holding guns;
Bombs bursting on either side, as the sun rose. 
A man cried from behind, a voice Volker knew: 
"Volker, schieß!Worauf wartest du?"
Volker lost, his way, his words, his sight,
Trapped within darkness, not a spot of light.
All he sees is loyalty, a commitment to hell!
But is it for the country or for Raphaël?
Raphaël lost the truth he seeks. 
"What is all this for? Is it greed or peace?
Volker is obviously oblivious and often so-
But today, God, I hope he will toughen up and grow!"
Waves of guilt battered his veins and skull,
Haunted by the bombs the world grew dull!
One deep breath, 
Loading the gun, 
Another deep breath, 
I'm sure it's no fun. 
Inhale, exhale, inhale again.
Their eyes fixed on each other,
Questioning their fate. 
They had to kill each other,
Yet neither could move
For there was no hate.
Inhale, exhale inhale again
Both closed their eyes and...
Behind Volker lay a bullet on the tree. 
Behind Raphaël lay a bullet on the wall. 
In the midst of war’s storm, grey and blue,
Their aims faltered, their hearts stayed true.
