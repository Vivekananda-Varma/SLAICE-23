Timeâ€™s frolic
A day, a year, a decade,
What progress has been made?
Has death gotten closer?
Is the earth getting older?
We ponder the future,
Yet dwell in the present,
Time flows away, only
a dream for tomorrow.
We repent the past,
Which no longer exists.
Let it be, 
And you shall be free,
To savour every fleeting day.
