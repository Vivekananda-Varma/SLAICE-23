        <p class="article-body-text">Origami is an art form that has always fascinated me, and my journey with it began in Kindergarten. I was introduced to it through paper planes and paper boats, which added a fun and exciting activity to our recess time. As I experimented with making paper planes and jets, I became increasingly interested in origami and its creative possibilities. What I found most fascinating about origami is how a simple piece of paper can be transformed into something beautiful and complex, without using scissors or glue. I began making simple origami animals like cats and dogs, and gradually progressed to more complex figures such as birds and boxes. Despite making progress in my origami skills, I always had a sense that there was still so much more to learn. In practising origami, I've learned the value of patience and the importance of striving for perfection. Each fold requires precision, attention to detail, and careful consideration of every step in the process. The focus and discipline required in making origami figures have taught me the importance of following each step with precision to achieve goals in life. I often find myself drawn to art forms that require precision, whether in origami or other creative pursuits. The lessons learned from practising origami have significantly impacted my approach to other aspects of life. For example, I have learned that being patient and diligent in my work builds not only a better result but a more satisfying and self-rewarding process. Overall, my experiences with origami have taught me the importance of being patient, diligent, and willing to work hard to achieve my goals. I may have started with paper planes and simple animals, but with continued practice, I hope to evolve my skills and learn even more about this fascinating art form.</p>
