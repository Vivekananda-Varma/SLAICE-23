        <p class="article-body-text">On one dull afternoon, I was strolling around aimlessly on the paved roads of Pondicherry. The sky was clear with clouds spread across it like white cotton balls. A pleasant breeze with a cooling effect was blowing gently. It was playing with my curly hair and was murmuring a delightful tune in my ears. </p>
        <p class="article-body-text">My gaze fell upon a French building. A tightly knit bougainvillaea crept down its tall walls. The creeper was in full bloom and the flower bunches had a tint of magenta and were vivid and bold. Suddenly it occurred to me that the significance given to this flower by The Mother is Protection, and the message it was giving out was true to its name; strong and protecting the building from dangers. </p>
        <p class="article-body-text">On the next turn, there were towering trees on both sides of the road. Their trunks were concealed with jagged pieces of bark, their wide-spread branches were covered with lush green leaves and tiny yellow flowers. Under the trees lay a carpet of those yellow flowers and in the air their redolence perfume unfurled. </p>
        <p class="article-body-text">At a distance, I heard an old woman with a vociferous voice calling out to everyone trying to sell her coconut water. As I was thirsty I walked down towards her and asked for one. I drank from the refreshing coconut and the water it contained was ambrosial. </p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Then, I decided to return home. While walking I reflected on all that I had seen and came to the conclusion that nature has infused great details in all of It's wonders, may it be as vast as the sky or as small as the yellow flowers.</p>
