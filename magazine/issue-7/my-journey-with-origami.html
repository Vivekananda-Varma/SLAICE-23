        <p>My Journey With Origami (with swan and wolf model) </p>
        <p>Origami is an art form that has always fascinated me, and my journey with it began in Kindergarten. I was introduced to it through paper planes and paper boats, which added a fun and exciting activity to our recess time. As I experimented with making paper planes and jets, I became increasingly interested in origami and its creative possibilities. What I found most fascinating about origami is how a simple piece of paper can be transformed into something beautiful and complex, without using scissors or glue. I began making simple origami animals like cats and dogs, and gradually progressed to more complex figures such as birds and boxes. Despite making progress in my origami skills, I always had a sense that there was still so much more to learn. In practising origami, I've learned the value of patience and the importance of striving for perfection. Each fold requires precision, attention to detail, and careful consideration of every step in the process. The focus and discipline required in making origami figures have taught me the importance of following each step with precision to achieve goals in life. I often find myself drawn to art forms that require precision, whether in origami or other creative pursuits. The lessons learned from practising origami have significantly impacted my approach to other aspects of life. For example, I have learned that being patient and diligent in my work builds not only a better result but a more satisfying and self-rewarding process. Overall, my experiences with origami have taught me the importance of being patient, diligent, and willing to work hard to achieve my goals. I may have started with paper planes and simple animals, but with continued practice, I hope to evolve my skills and learn even more about this fascinating art form. </p>
        <p>Tejaswini- The Power Of Imagination</p>
        <p>My Neighbor Totoro is an animated film directed by Hayao Miyazaki and produced by Studio Ghibli. The film is about two sisters who relocate to Japan's countryside with their father. One of the most fascinating features of this film is its themes and symbolism.</p>
        <p>Totoro appears as a conceptual character in the film. He is a huge, fluffy creature with grey fur, sharp ears, and a broad grin. He is the forest spirit and the guardian of nature. Mei, the younger sister, depicts innocence, curiosity, and childlike delight. Satsuki, the older sister, depicts perseverance and courage. To protect her loved ones, she fearlessly overcomes obstacles. And who would find the concept of a Catbus not interesting? The idea of the Catbus is fantastic. It depicts a connection between the fantasy world and reality. </p>
        <p>The film emphasises on how important it is to preserve our sense of wonder and imagination. Without that the world would be boring, and we would not find delight in the most ordinary things. It also indicates the relevance of familial relationships in a society. I don't know if this is normal in Japanese culture, but the movie depicts very well that one family's child is the whole village's child. The scenery of the countryside in the film is breathtaking, and allows us to admire the beauty and magic of nature.</p>
        <p>There are many lessons that we can learn from this movie. The first and foremost, is to respect, preserve, and protect the environment. To see the beauty of nature we need to be receptive and believe in nature's power. It suggests that we should keep our sense of wonder and imagination like children. By doing so we would find joy in the simplest of things. Also, we must recognize the value of love and support within families and communities. It is their love which gives us strength in difficult times.</p>
        <p>My Neighbor Totoro is a lovely film. It is an entertaining movie that can appeal to both children and adults. Even though it was released in 1988, it is still relevant and adored because it has important truths of nature revealed in it. Everyone should remember these truths and never disregard them.        </p>
