Passing Time

These artworks reflect my passion for anime. I enjoy exploring different styles and love drawing my favourite characters, while experimenting with colors and expressions to bring them to life. Each piece represents a moment of creative flow, where I tried to capture the energy and emotions that make anime so compelling. I hope my work can inspire others to explore their own creativity through art and hopefully start watching Anime.
