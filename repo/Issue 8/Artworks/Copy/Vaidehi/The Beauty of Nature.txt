The Beauty of Nature

Imagine having grown up with nature, yet never having really observed it. I am guilty of overlooking the beauty that surrounded me ever since I was little. Years later, I chose to look; to observe the common. These disregarded elements of nature revealed to me that it is quite simple to find beauty in the ordinary. It just requires some patience. Here I present to you some of my work that has been done amidst the enchanting flowers and trees of “Maturudyanam”.
