Between the Covers

So, how do I begin
To describe everything
About a little book?
Well, come on in, take a look!

Every book starts with a cover
Each one different from another
Be it boring or colourful,
All of them are wonderful!

Let us all dive inside
With the contents as your guide,
You will never get confused
When it is being used!

But let us not stop now,
Just take a quick vow
To continue reading,
Even though it’s just the beginning!

And so we start
With our brave hearts
To endure the twists and turns
While we even learn!

The characters leap out
And join us on this route
To teach us everything,
With lots of joy to bring!

So many different types,
Yet all of them I like
From horror to history,
Romance to mystery!

But that is not just it,
There IS another bit!
The part of the mind,
Which we mustn’t leave behind!

Everything stays with you,
Helps you through and through
Be it your sadness,
Or even your madness!

The rustle of the pages
Takes you through the stages
The smell of the book
Makes you want to take a look!

And finally, the feeling
Which might send you reeling
Through times happy and sad
But after them, you’ll feel glad-

For this beautiful thing
Which is like a wing
Helping you take flight
Towards that wonderful light!
