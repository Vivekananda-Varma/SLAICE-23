Editorial

Finally, after long, tiring months of hard work by our designers, countless drafts by our authors, and many late nights of drawing and sketching by our artists, the team is proud to present the 8th edition of "SLAICE – A Slice of SAICE". This year’s edition has no set theme. Instead, we wanted to give the students the freedom to let their creativity flow, whether through photos, artwork, poetry, or stories.

As you turn these pages, you’ll see what our students have been passionately working on. Some authors recount their experience during soup time or the excitement of watching a friend break records! Others take us into eerie tales or give us a sneak peek at their upcoming novel. And don’t miss our featured interview, where we dive into the origins of our beloved aquarium.

Our young poets have also shared with us their work, drawing inspiration from the fiery passion of the color red, the peaceful melody of wind chimes, and the blossoming of love. With the added beauty of our illustrators’ drawings, their words leap off the page.

We also have the E4 class describing their experiences while working on their "5 Elements" program. From costumes to set design, to the thrill of being on stage, they offer a glimpse into what goes into putting up a theatre performance.

And of course, we can’t forget our talented artists. Be sure to check out the incredible artwork created by our students, exploring various mediums and methods of expression. Some ventured into digital portraits of favorite characters, while others captured serene landscapes like Lake. Additionally, we have a photo essay that is sure to stir up childhood memories.

With all this and a lot more, I sit here wondering what more to add to this editorial, I realize there's nothing left to say. So, dear reader, I leave you to immerse yourself in everything the team has to offer.

Happy reading!
