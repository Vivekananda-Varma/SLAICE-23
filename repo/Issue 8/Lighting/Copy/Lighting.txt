Lighting

Lighting was completely new to me, so I thought, why not give it a shot? Vinay da gave us a brief introduction to lighting—covering direction, focus, color, density, and more—but initially, it didn’t catch my interest. Still, I trusted the process, and I’m glad I did because I wasn’t disappointed.
As the days went on, Vinay da demonstrated how he controls the light projection from the cabin onto the cyclorama. That’s when I truly became fascinated. I started visiting the theater almost every night to discuss lighting with him and the rest of the team. I appreciated how open Vinay da was to suggestions and ideas, which really helped us harmonize as a team. As a result, I began talking more and growing closer to my classmates.
I took control of the manual lights for a while, and I quickly realized that they weren’t as easy to handle as I had imagined! It took me quite some time to smoothly move them around, but focusing the light remained a challenge. I finally managed to get the focus right—just one day before the program!
I’m deeply grateful to Vinay da for his patience and understanding. These few weeks have been some of the best of my life. I truly enjoyed this entire journey. For me, it wasn’t just about the program; it was a journey of self-discovery.
My character has changed so much! I feel more confident, more connected to my classmates and teachers—it feels like a family now. Honestly, I’ve never felt this free to just be myself in front of everyone before. There are no words that can fully capture this experience; it’s something that has to be felt.
While I’m thrilled the program went well, there’s also a small part of me that feels sad because I’ll no longer wake up thinking, "Yes! Theater!" I’ll miss the practices, the teamwork, and even Priyanka di’s calls for “silence!”
I’m already looking forward to one more program before November 1st!
