Organization Team

Our team consisted of Dhivith, Ananya, Ajit Da, Nidhi, Vishwanath, and myself (Krishiv). Our primary goal throughout the workshop was to organize the daily schedule, coordinating with teachers who needed students at specific times.
We were limited to about one and a half hours of practice time because group typically finished around 7 p.m. Considering that participants would usually refresh themselves, have dinner, and unwind, we allocated about 45 minutes for this cool-down period, including travel time to the theatre.
From 7:45 p.m. to 9:30 p.m., we held rehearsals. Since some students lived far away and cycled home, they wouldn’t reach until around 10 p.m., exhausted and without much motivation left for homework unless they had particularly strict teachers—hence the practice time limit.
We began each day with a 7 a.m. meeting in the school galleries to organize that day’s and the following day’s schedules. However, this often led to us scheduling another meeting for the day after. Vishwanath and I, being boarding students, found it difficult to attend these early meetings, leaving us with only 15 minutes for breakfast—but we managed.
There were times when the day's challenges were so demanding that we couldn’t finalize the schedule for the next day, forcing us to meet in the theatre in the evening to plan for it.
Once project week arrived, our role became less necessary since everyone was in the theatre at their designated times. Teachers could simply walk around, select the students they needed, and continue with their work.
As the situation evolved, we adapted by taking on additional responsibilities, even if they weren’t strictly required. Over the course of this three-week adventure, we learned how to negotiate effectively. If that failed, we would push our opinions into the schedule. And if the requirements still weren’t met, we took the initiative to do what we felt was right—whether it was the correct decision or not.
