Padma
The Symbolism of Lotus in Hinduism 

The lotus as known in Sanskrit as Kamala and Padma holds a central position in Hindu mythology, art and literature, symbolising eternity, creation and enlightenment. It is closely associated with deities like Brahma, Vishnu and Lakshmi and it has its representation in ancient texts like the Rig Veda and the Atharva Veda, where the lotus embodies profound spiritual and philosophical concepts.
In Hindu cosmology, the lotus emerges as a symbol of creation, purity and divine manifestation. It is said that a stalk of lotus has been sprouted from the navel of Vishnu, who reclined on his serpent couch, Ananta, amidst the celestial waters. This lotus bore Brahma, the creator, born from its petals which is considered a duplicate manifestation of the goddess Padma, also known as Sri or Lakshmi, herself which indicates the divine origin of life and the universe, as depicted in Vedic hymns and later Hindu scriptures.
In the Gopala-uttaratapini Upanishad, it is depicted that the lotus, emerging from the depths of water, symbolises purity and the cohesive force (sattva) from which the principles of conduct (dharma) and knowledge (jnana) arise. It is often regarded as representing the six transcendent powers (bhaga) associated with divinity (bhagavan).
Since ancient Vedic times, water has been regarded as a manifestation of the divine essence and that is why oceans and rivers are recurrent motifs in Hindu mythology. Pundarika or the lotus growth in primordial waters symbolises the life-sustaining force and spiritual purity. Its emergence from these sacred waters represents the purity of heart and mind, as well as the aspiration for spiritual enlightenment amidst the murky depths of worldly existence.
The goddess Lakshmi holds a revered position in Hindu mythology and has a very close association with the lotus which she is often depicted standing gracefully upon. She symbolises fertility, abundance, and the wealth of the earth's treasures. The earliest literary mention of Lakshmi can be found in the Shri Sukta hymn, a supplement to the Rigveda, where she is hailed by various epithets like "the one possessed of the lotus" (Padmini), "the lotus-coloured (Amar)," and "the lotus-born (Padmasambhava)." 
The lotus holds a significant place in Hindu art often serving as a pedestal or kamalasana for divine figures. Initially associated with Brahma and Lakshmi but over time the lotus symbol expanded its significance in Hindu iconography, becoming associated with various divinities which turned out to become a symbol of support for all deities embodying the highest transcendental essence.
The lotus also holds significance due to Vishnu, who presented one thousand lotus buds daily in reverence to Shiva. One day he discovered a missing bud during his prayers, so Vishnu, whose eyes were often compared to lotus buds (padmaksha), replaced it with one of his own eyes.
Throughout the ages, the lotus has occupied a sacred role in Hinduism. Its presence in ancient texts emphasises its enduring significance in spiritual and philosophical discourse embedding profound spiritual truths and serving as a timeless emblem of the highest transcendental essence.
