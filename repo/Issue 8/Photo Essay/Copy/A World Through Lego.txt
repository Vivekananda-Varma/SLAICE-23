A World Through Lego

My journey with Lego photography began with a childhood love of storytelling. When I was younger, I was fascinated by the numerous possibilities I had to create my own worlds. Lego sets, with their customizable characters and scenes felt like alternate, improved realities compare to the one I found myself in. I could build any kind of world I wanted and sit back and watch as a relentless battle ensued between Luke Skywalker and some Sandtroopers. 
Over time I realized that the Lego characters could actually be brought to life by means of photography. Photographing miniature sets allowed me to express my imagination in the real world. I was able to create nearly anything, including from scenes inspired by movies. One picture at a time I'm able to bring all the scenes I have imagined to life.
