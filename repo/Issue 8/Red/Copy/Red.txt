Red

Red is the sun flaring day and night,
Red the firewood which you ignite,
Red, blood of warriors, who battle with might,
Red, tender love, a motherâ€™s kiss to sleep tight.

Red are the sunsets and every sunrise,
Painting their fiery glow across the skies,
Red is a chilli, overflowing with spice,
Red hot the lava, melting ancient ice.

Love can be red, so too revenge and rage,
Our hate that grows red as it festers with age,
Spills red blood of the young in wars nations wage,
Red anguish of a red bird, locked forever in a cage.

Red is the heart when it is broken in two:
Combating falsehood, yearning for what is true.
Red is needing friends when having few,
Red is the devil trying to instigate you-

He mocks you in secret and pierces your being,
And from the divine, he keeps you unseeing.
He means to imprison when you think he is freeing,
With red flame for red pride, red glow of your glee-ing.

Mother, red is the new dawn when him you defeat.
Red flower am I now, at Thy red-lined feet.

-Dyuman(E.A.V.P. 3)
