The Storm

The storm, a lion prowling with thunderous roar,
Silent in his approach, in darkness and light,
Awaiting to crash boats onto empty shores
And shake the earth with his majestic might.

His waves of roars do drown the very air,
Tossing and tearing everything apart,
With eyes of lightning, fierce and so proud,
He blinds the world from his lonely rampart.

Full soon his comrades, the teeming clouds disperse,
Parting the veil from dark to growing light,
The king takes rest at last in misty downs,
Waiting to strike another night.

-Titirat(E.A.V.P. 6)
