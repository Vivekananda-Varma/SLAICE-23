The Wind Chime

The landscape is filled with greenery,
Yet it doesn't heal my misery.
I hope to find my Golden Fleece, 
Which shall grant me eternal peace.

I stumble upon an abandoned hut
With all its windows tightly shut.
But my gaze fixes upon a wind chime
And gone was the definition of time.

The tinkle of the chime at twilight, 
When the day is turning into night,
The twinkling of the now bright star
Takes me to a land that is quite so far.

The song it creates makes me peaceful 
And puts my worries in a bagful.
It makes me want to meet the composer
Of the most relaxing music ever.
