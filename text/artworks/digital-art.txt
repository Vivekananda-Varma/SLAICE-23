Titirat- Digital Art 
Why did I start digital art?
Ever since I was small, I've always fancied drawing and colouring. They were my favourite time pass. I even took a few drawing lessons on weekends when I was small. As I grew up, my love for that hobby did not fade away. I still draw whenever I am free and feel inspired in a way. When I came across digital art for the first time on YouTube, I was extremely fascinated by it. One of the main reasons was that the apps provided us with many features, such as; brushes, textures, tools and colours. It made my creativity limitless. I would definitely recommend digital art for the people who share a liking for drawing, and I promise you, you won't be disappointed.
