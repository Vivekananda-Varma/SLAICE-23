The Salt Effect in Watercolour
I enjoy watercolour painting as it has always been a way to express myself. I love the flow of the colours and their transparency. This year I tried a new technique in my arts class, called the salt effect in watercolour. I first start with a paper wash (wet the paper with water using a big brush). Then I add the colours and let the paint take the flow of the water. The trickiest part of the painting is knowing when to sprinkle the salt. The right time to add is when the paper is wet enough for the salt to absorb the paint. If the paper is too wet, the salt dissolves in water. If it is too dry, it doesnâ€™t absorb the colours. Thus, when sprinkled at the right moment, the salt leaves a white starry effect on the paper. Once the salt dries up, I gently brush it off the paper.
