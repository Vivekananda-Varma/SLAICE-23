Chaitanya - Photography 
As a photography student, my journey into this captivating art form began unexpectedly during a family vacation to the ruins of Nalanda University in 2016. A mere 13 years old at the time, my parents had graciously gifted me a new smartphone with an 8MP camera, which became my initial canvas for exploration. Little did I know that this modest device would ignite a strong passion of capturing the world through my lens.
Fast forward to E4, when I finally got my first DSLR camera as my 16th Birthday gift. Since then, my trusty camera has become my constant companion on every adventure, a tool for discovering fresh perspectives and inspirations in every place I visit.
Like any aspiring artist, I've often found myself unsatisfied with my work. But amid all this self-criticism, a turning point in my photography path sometimes sticks out. Last year, I went on a trek to the Har Ki Doon Valley. This mesmerising location left an indelible mark on my artistic sensibilities. Although my photographs only partially encapsulate the valley's grandeur, they offer a glimpse into its captivating beauty.
