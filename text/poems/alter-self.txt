Alter-Self 
If I were to be
In an alternative reality, 
Assuming I'm the only one alive,
I'd walk through the empty roads
And then I'd feel a strong heartbeat,
And follow that sound with my tiny bare feet.
By now, curiosity has filled my lungs,
and I can't wait to discover this other being.
With a little disappointment and a little expectation
I presume that I'm not the only one.
I see the moving shadow 
going further, and I continue to follow.
My legs are tired of running
and suddenly, this appears to me like a nostalgic feeling.
Just for a second, I look up at the darkened sky and a few stars,
and they tell me that's where they always are.
There's a million more, hidden but not too far.
I've recovered my breath
In this world, I'm totally unfamiliar with-
And now I'm just lost in this town 
where even a ghost at sight
would make me feel alive.
My voice echoes off, 
and now it's just my eyes,
running miles.
All I see are silhouettes,
But I guess that's just in my head.
This city seems old,
and as I look around to chase,
a foreign wind cuts across my face;
reminding me that here, it's just me.
I look down with hopelessness,
that's exactly when I hear it again.
There's no more of hide-and-seek
the shadow's right in front of me.
To my surprise, there was no other soul I was seeking for
This figure was mine, all along.
