Green Tunnel Lane
“I still freeze when I look at these faded photographs from February.” 
That walk down the silent chilly elm roads, it was you who made it so memorable. As we skipped, tripped and slow danced down the surreal Green Tunnel Lane we clicked this polaroid which still remains. 
Once again I visited the Green Tunnel Lane, except this time it wasn't as green under the stormy rain. I dilly-dallied my way down the lonely road, and I gently sat down recollecting those memories that we made. I placed the polaroid picture on the bench, and watched it soak through and through with each and every teary raindrop. But alas, I had to let go of this crystalised memory, I had to set this soul free.
