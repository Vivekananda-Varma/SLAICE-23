        <H2 class="article-heading">Earth Set Design</H2>
        <p class="article-author">Students of EAVP 4 | EAVP 4</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">I chose set design as my primary department because I’ve always been drawn to working with my hands, and whenever I watch a performance, my focus naturally gravitates toward the sets. For me, theater sets are what create the mood and atmosphere, making them an essential part of any performance.  </p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Initially, I thought working on sets wouldn’t be too difficult since I enjoy crafting, but I quickly realized how wrong I was. Time was a constant challenge—we had less than a month to complete the sets while managing school responsibilities. At one point, I even considered giving up because the task wasn’t just about building a structure to enhance the performance; it also involved gathering the right materials, which turned out to be the hardest part.  </p>
        <p class="article-body-text">We spent a lot of time hunting for materials from different departments to create props and sets. For the Earth element, we had to make ropes from scratch using old bedsheets. We approached around four or five people just to collect 13 old bedsheets, which we then cut into strips and braided together. To extend the length of the ropes, we had to sew the braids together, but we didn’t have a sewing machine. So, we visited different departments, asking for help and even learning how to sew, though we faced several rejections along the way.  </p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Talking to so many people for assistance was a new and challenging experience for me. It was something I had never done before, and navigating those situations pushed me out of my comfort zone.  </p>
        <p class="article-body-text">To achieve the right color for the ropes, we needed to dye them. We sought advice from Habul da on the dyeing process and collected the materials from Praful Bhai's department. However, we also needed a suitable place for dyeing. After talking to several people, Reba di from the handmade paper department kindly offered us space on the terrace. We experimented with different quantities of dye until we finally got it right. By the time we finished dyeing, it hit me that we only had 15 days left to create the rest of the sets for the other elements.  </p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Thankfully, we completed the ropes earlier than expected, which allowed the dancers to practice with them. Although there were some minor errors, they weren’t significant enough to slow us down.  </p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Working on the Earth set was the highlight of the entire month for me. I learned so much during that process, and spending time with my friends outside of school hours in the theater felt harmonious. It was one of the best experiences I’ve had so far. While we were creating the props, we also saw the lighting team experimenting with the Earth element. We came up with a second set for Earth, this time using eco-friendly wrapping paper for the background. It was beautiful, and it opened my eyes to new ways of working with materials. The whole process was filled with discovery.  </p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Through working with the set design team, I bonded with my teammates in ways I hadn’t expected. It was so different from how I knew them in school. When we worked together, I saw a different side of them—people I had known for a long time suddenly became more familiar to me in a new and deeper way. I’d call it a journey of self-discovery. They were always there, but I had never seen them as I did while we were working together. That, for me, was the most beautiful part of the whole experience—getting to know more about my friends through teamwork.</p>
