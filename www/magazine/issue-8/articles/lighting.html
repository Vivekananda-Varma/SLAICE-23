        <H2 class="article-heading">Lighting</H2>
        <p class="article-author">Students of EAVP 4 | EAVP 4</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Lighting was completely new to me, so I thought, why not give it a shot? Vinay da gave us a brief introduction to lighting—covering direction, focus, color, density, and more—but initially, it didn’t catch my interest. Still, I trusted the process, and I’m glad I did because I wasn’t disappointed.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">As the days went on, Vinay da demonstrated how he controls the light projection from the cabin onto the cyclorama. That’s when I truly became fascinated. I started visiting the theater almost every night to discuss lighting with him and the rest of the team. I appreciated how open Vinay da was to suggestions and ideas, which really helped us harmonize as a team. As a result, I began talking more and growing closer to my classmates.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">I took control of the manual lights for a while, and I quickly realized that they weren’t as easy to handle as I had imagined! It took me quite some time to smoothly move them around, but focusing the light remained a challenge. I finally managed to get the focus right—just one day before the program!</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">I’m deeply grateful to Vinay da for his patience and understanding. These few weeks have been some of the best of my life. I truly enjoyed this entire journey. For me, it wasn’t just about the program; it was a journey of self-discovery.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">My character has changed so much! I feel more confident, more connected to my classmates and teachers—it feels like a family now. Honestly, I’ve never felt this free to just be myself in front of everyone before. There are no words that can fully capture this experience; it’s something that has to be felt.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">While I’m thrilled the program went well, there’s also a small part of me that feels sad because I’ll no longer wake up thinking, "Yes! Theater!" I’ll miss the practices, the teamwork, and even Priyanka di’s calls for “silence!”</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">I’m already looking forward to one more program before November 1st!</p>
