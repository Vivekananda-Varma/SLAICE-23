        <H2 class="article-heading">Planet Grown-up</H2>
        <p class="article-author">Dia S | EAVP 1</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Grown-ups are like characters from another planet, where everyone wears clothes of “seriousness”. This language includes phrases like, ” Because I said so,” “You’ll understand when you’re older,” and a mysterious phrase which is “the good old days.” And let’s not forget their love for organizing things! A neat cupboard is a life achievement!</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Despite all of this, they can fix anything, even a blank stare into an unhelpful guide. They can always find anything we have lost: Mom’s superpower is finding that misplaced geography notebook every single time! Although sometimes their jokes might be outdated,  I love the fact that they are trying to make us smile.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">The most amazing thing about grown-ups is their memory. They have this incredible ability to remember their childhood as if it were the most adventurous time ever. “Back in my days, we spent our time climbing trees, not scrolling through phones,” they say with a twinkle in their eyes. It’s very sweet to think that they were once as clueless and as mischievous as we are now.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Maybe, just maybe, when we grow up, we will also be part of the cupboard organizing club, memory-hoarding beings who thrive on coffee and funny conversations about the weather and finally, understand the weird language of: “Grown-Upish.” Maybe we’ll even develop our secret signals like the subtle eyebrow raise, just like Mom does it, or the discreet nod that Dad does while communicating with Mom without saying a word. </p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Until then, we’ll continue to be the happy 13-year-old children we are, navigating through the world of the Grown-Ups with curiosity and humour.</p>
