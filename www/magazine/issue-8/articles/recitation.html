        <p class="article-body-text">This is a reflection on my journey in putting together the ‘5 Elements’ performance.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Priyanka di, Vinay da, and Mrityunjay da organized a workshop that introduced us to various aspects of performing arts, sharing their own experiences as students. When the idea of putting on a performance was first proposed, I wasn’t particularly drawn to it. The prospect of performing in any form had always scared me—it was far outside my comfort zone. Now that I reflect on it, I realize that my indifference stemmed from past unpleasant experiences with similar programs.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Fortunately, during the course of these two months, all my preconceived notions were shattered. The performance became an immersive experience, and as I look back on it now, I can honestly say I thoroughly enjoyed myself and was fully invested in everything I took part in.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">In June, a sheet was put up on our class board, and we were asked to choose roles in different aspects of performing arts. I signed up for both organization and stage management, which was unusual for me. I had never willingly taken charge of anything before, but I decided to take on the challenge.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">I remember sitting restlessly in the school galleries, questioning whether I had made the right choice—but it was too late to back out. During our first meeting, I was in silent awe of Ajit da, who planned everything so systematically. However, after a few meetings, I began to get the hang of things and felt like this was something I was meant to do. Despite my lack of prior experience, I believe I contributed to the team as the weeks went by.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">As part of the organization team, our job was to coordinate the daily requirements for movement, lighting, audio, sets, costumes, music, and poetry for the venue. We had to ensure that the students and their needs were taken care of, all while working around other ongoing programs. We often had to negotiate and find ways to accommodate everyone’s needs. After considering every possibility, we would finally put up the schedule for the day. The entire team was ready to work long hours, often with just 15-30 minute breaks for changing and dinner.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Our meetings were held every other day at 7 a.m. to plan for that day and the next. Initially, Ajit da guided us through the process, but soon, Dhivith and Ananya took charge and did an excellent job. After a while, Krishiv, Vishwanath, and I took over, though the others continued to double-check our work to ensure everything ran smoothly. Over time, we functioned like a well-oiled machine. Everyone was encouraged to express their opinions, and we respected each other's suggestions. With Ajit da as the backbone, we never experienced any internal conflicts, and we bonded well as a team.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">Surprisingly, organization turned out to be more fun than I expected, and it provided a platform for personal growth and development. Organization is a creative process that requires initiative and resourcefulness. Initially, we planned to transition from organization to stage management, but we soon realized that stage management required individuals solely dedicated to it.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">In addition to organization, I was introduced to poetry recitals in E.3, which I immediately fell in love with. Along with Unmesha and Shreemayi, I was chosen to perform poetry that would set the stage for portraying the five elements. Our poetry wove a narrative that connected the personal to the abstract. Our guides, Udit da and Kruti di, encouraged us to write our own lines of poetry and gladly included them in the final script. We spent over two weeks brainstorming ideas for each element, and once we had mind-mapped everything, we began manifesting those ideas into reality.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">At first, we had an abundance of ideas, as the possibilities for a theme like this are endless. With time constraints, we had to sift through them and prioritize the ones that were most feasible. We focused our energy on bringing those to life.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">On the final day, as I approached the foreground, I felt an immense joy—not the nerves I usually feel before a performance. I knew I was living fully in the present moment, and it felt like this was where I was meant to be.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">There were times when I wondered if I had taken on too much, as I had also involved myself with set design. At times, it felt overwhelming, but there were also moments when this felt like my everything—as if it was my sole purpose. During those moments, I would step back, collect myself, and refocus on making the most of the experience. Over time, I realized that my abilities were growing, and my plate wasn’t full just yet.</p>
        <p class="article-body-text">As the month progressed, momentum built, and our collective dedication and passion came together as we neared the final day. By the end, we emerged transformed by the experience, each of us having undergone our own journey.</p>
